# CI Setup for React JavaScript Ecosystem

## Overview

In a typical Continuous Integration (CI) setup for a React JavaScript project, several steps are crucial to ensure the quality and reliability of the code. These steps include linting, testing, and building. While they are common steps, the details of it are really depends on the projects' need.

### Linting

Popular tools in the React ecosystem are ESLint and Prettier. ESLint checks is used for syntax errors, code style, and best practices. While Prettier focuses on code formatting.

### Testing

Jest is a widely used testing framework for React applications. It provides a lot of features out of the box, such as code coverage, snapshot testing, and mocking.

### Building

Webpack is a popular choice for bundling and optimizing React applications. It can be configured to work with other tools, like Babel, for transpiling ES6 code.

### Alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions

Besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, other popular CI tools include:

* GitLab CI/CD
* CircleCI
* Travis CI
* Concourse CI
* TeamCity

### Self-hosted vs Cloud-based Environment

Whether to set up a CI environment in a self-hosted or cloud-based environment depends on several factors, such as:

* **Control and customization**: How much control is needed over the CI environment, and how much customization is required?
* **Scalability and maintenance**: How scalable does the CI environment need to be, and what are the maintenance requirements?
* **Cost**: What is their budget?
* **Size of the team and what their roles**: How large is the team and what are their roles?
* **Complexity of the project**: How complex is the project, and what are the specific needs and requirements?

I cannot really decide on behalf of the team, first of all I do not have the complete picture of the needs and requirements. Second, I am not in anyway affiliated with the team nor participated in the development, so they need to come up with the decision among themselves.
